This skill then summons a Muji-Muji Daruma.\n\n**Muji-Muji Daruma**\nAt specific intervals, the Daruma will take one of several actions based on the situation around it:\n·If the HP of nearby characters is above 70%, it will attack a nearby opponent, dealing Anemo DMG.\n·If there are active characters with 70% or less HP nearby, it will heal the active character with the lowest percentage HP left. If there are no opponents nearby, it will heal active characters nearby even if they have 70% HP or more.","description":"People who don't know the first thing about ninjutsu love to watch Sayu show off this skill, and some have tried to learn it from her.
